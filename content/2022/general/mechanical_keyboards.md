My first computer was a C64 when I was a child. Later when I used the first i486 PC (still as a child) it had an IBM keyboard.

A beautiful, white-grey and clicky keyboard, I guess it was the Model M.

The memory of writing on such a great keyboard faded during the years of using membrane dome keyboards.

I learned touchtyping in secondary school, and I practiced typing on a mechanical typewriter at home.

Later using different ThinkPads gave me back some pleasure of typing again. The keyboards on the T61 to the T420 were exceptionally great. I still like the keyboard of the newer ThinkPad models, but the feeling of my L380 is far from the keyboards of the older models.

Recently I developed lower hand and wrist pain because I type a lot, so I decided to look around on the market of the mechanical keyboards. **It was a wonderful idea!**

# Membrane rubber dome vs mechanical keyboards: what's the difference?

I break it down to physical and non-physical differences. Some of the non-physical differences are subjective, or they are just my personal opinion.

## Physical differences

Most **membrane keyboards** have an electrical plate below the keys. A pressed key transfers an electronic signal to the receiver at the bottom of its movement to be registered. All keys give these signals to the same large element. Rubber domes under the keys push back the keycaps to their original place. That is why they give us a soft feeling of typing.

The **mechanical keyboards** have mechanical switches (suprpirse!) below all individual keys. Different switches have different behavior while typing. Mechanical switches have a spring inside, it pushes back the stem to its orignal place.
Keyboards have a property called [key rollover](https://www.mechanical-keyboard.org/n-key-rollover-explained/) that tells us how many keys can we press together at a time and the keyboard still registers them. Mechanical keyboards have N-key rollover that means we can press unlimited keys and they are still registered.
Theoretically we can press all keys at once.

## Non-physical differences

Due to the physical properties of different switches the feeling is different by switch types:

1. **Linear** switches are silent and there is not a tactile, bumpy feeling when pressing the keys.
1. **Tactile** switches are a bit louder than the linear ones, they give a bumpy, tactile feedback when pressing the key.
1. **Clicky** switches are the loudest switches. They are like the tactile ones with a clicky sound at the bump.

Theoretically mechanical keyboards will last longer and they are more durable.

Mechanical keys lower the strain on the typing hands.

Mechanical keyboards increase the typing speed because of the high actuation point and good feedback of the keypresses.

Rubber dome keyboards are cheaper to produce and buy.

# The Keychron K2 v2 hot-swap aluminium body keyboard

I purchased the keyboard after carefully reading a lot of pages of reviews, I watched videos about the topic and even I asked the opinion of some mechanical keyboard enthusiasts.

After some careful consideration the [Keychron](https://www.keychron.com/) came out as my best option.

Considering my habits and desk setup I had to decide between TKL and 75%. (TKL or "ten key less" is a keyboard layout without the numeric part, the 75% keyboard is a more compressed layout with an even rows of keys.) Finally I decided to go small/narrow and chose the [75% K2 v2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-hot-swappable-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) model.

I saw good reviews about the [Gateron G Pro switches](https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-mechanical-keyboard-switches), but I wanted the possibility of changing the switches whenever I want to, so I went for the hot-swap version.

Finally as I am a touchtyper with reasonably good typing speed I chose the tactile switches. It means the **Gateron G Pro Brown** ones. I may change them some time to the clicky blue switches, but currently I am 100% happy with the feeling of typing on this keyboard.

As a little addition to the setup (and to my comfort) I chose to order the wooden wrist rest. I hesitated about it, but the keyboard's frame is quite thick, and when I am not in heavy typing, I like to rest my hands in front of the keyboard. The wrist rest is worth every penny, it is elegant and it makes the keyboard very comfortable.

# Orange Keycaps

The orange esc and light keycaps go well with my ThinkPad mouse's red wheel and with my ThinkPad's trackpoint. :)
