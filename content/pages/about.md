I count almost two decades of experience in IT engineering and development.
I have hands-on experience with Linux systems, networks, Cyber Security, penetration testing and software development.
My main field is Linux, but I am familiar with Windows as well.
I keep up with learning new technology every day for staying relevant with my professional knowledge.
